This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Deflator

The [Green Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/685903/The_Green_Book.pdf) stipulates (p.23) that

> Costs and benefits in appraisal of social value should be estimated in ‘real’ base year prices
(i.e. the first year of the proposal). This means the effects of general inflation should be removed. 

> For short time horizons, whole economy inflation (the “GDP deflator”) from the most
recent forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)

The latest [GDP deflators for 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/gdp-deflators-at-market-prices-and-money-gdp-march-2019-quarterly-national-accounts) are available from GOV.UK as an [Excel spreadsheet](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835509/GDP_Deflators_Qtrly_National_Accounts_September_2019_update.xlsx).

### Download the deflators

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(fs)

temp_file <- fs::file_temp()

download.file("https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835509/GDP_Deflators_Qtrly_National_Accounts_September_2019_update.xlsx", temp_file)

gdp_deflator <-
  read_excel(
    temp_file,
    range = "B9:D76",
    col_names = c(
      "financial_year",
      "skip",
      "percent_change"
    ),
    col_types = c("text", "skip", "numeric")
  ) %>%
  mutate(financial_year = as.integer(str_sub(financial_year, 1L, 4L)),
         percent_change = percent_change / 100 + 1)
```

### Use the deflators

```{r}
#' Inflate or Deflate by GDP
#'
#' @param price in pounds (GBP, numeric)
#' @param from financial year of the price (numeric, `2018` is the
#' 2018/19 financial year)
#' @param to financial year to inflate to (integer, `2019` is the
#' 2019/20 financial year)
#'
#' @examples
#' x <- flate_gdp(100, from = 2017, to = 2019)
#' x
#' flate_gdp(x, from = 2019, to = 2017)
#' @export
flate_gdp <- function(price, from, to) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(price))
  stopifnot(is.numeric(from))
  stopifnot(is.numeric(to))

  inflator <-
    gdp_deflator %>%
    dplyr::filter(financial_year > min(from, to), 
                  financial_year <= max(from, to)) %>%
    dplyr::pull(percent_change) %>%
    cumprod() %>%
    tail(1L)
  
  if (to > from) {
    price * inflator
  } else {
    price / inflator
  }
}

flate_gdp(100, 2017, 2019)
flate_gdp(103.9335, 2019, 2017)
```
